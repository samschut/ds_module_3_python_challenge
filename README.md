# ds_module_3_python_challenge
In this challenge, we will use Python to analyze a budget data set in order to show profits, losses and number of months total. We will also be looking at Voter ID in relation to county and candidate information.
We coded in order to create a text file of the information we wanted to display. 
We used dictionaries, for loops, writing to text file to name a few skills we learned in class.
